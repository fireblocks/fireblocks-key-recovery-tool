# Fireblocks recovery key utility
## Installation

* Please clone the repository:
  * `git clone https://github.com/fireblocks/fireblocks-key-recovery-tool.git`

* cd fireblocks-key-recovery-tool

### Prerequisites
* Follow the steps to [create a Workspace Keys Backup file](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/360012223159-Workspace-Keys-Backup-and-Recovery-Hard-Key-Recovery-)
* Your Owner must have their Owner recovery passphrase

## Running in Docker

### Build the utility in docker
* docker build -t fb_recover_key.

### Run the utility in docker
* cd to `<directory containing the backup file and the private key>`
* Run: docker run -it -v "${PWD}:/opt/fb_recover_keys/backup" fb_recover_key:latest bash
* See below for instructions on how to run the recovery tool.

## Running Locally

### Build the utility locally
* install python 3.9
* install pip3
* run: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### Run the utility locally
* See below for instructions on how to run the recovery tool for a full recovery.

  1. Recommended: 
      * run `./fireblocks_key_backup_and_recovery.py`

      #### It opens a menu with the following options:
      1. Create a recovery key pair - generate a recovery key-pair. You will be required to
      create a key pair passphrase to encrypt the private key file from the key pair.
      2. Verify the public backup key - verify the public key file of the recovery key-pair. 
      This is useful for users with Self-Serve backups who want to validate that their workspace 
      Owner’s request to back up the keys matches the key pair at their premise. Requires the 
      recovery key-pair public key.
      3. Verify the recovery package - run a sanity test of the workspace key backup package. 
      Requires: the backup package, the recovery key pair private key file, the passphrase to that 
      private  key file, and the owner’s passphrase.
      4. Reveal the private backup key - Requires: the backup package, the recovery key pair 
      private key file, the passphrase to that private key file, and the owner’s passphrase.

  2. Use the Legacy script:  `./fb_recover_keys.py`
     Unlike with the recommended method above, with this method you need to prepare the recovery private key in advance.
     For sanity tests:
    * run `./fb_recover_keys.py <backup zip file> <RSA recovery private key>` 
     
     For Private key reconstruction - SHOULD NOT BE DONE ON PRODUCTION KITS UNLESS THERE IS A DISASTER SCENARIO:
    * run  `./fb_recover_keys.py <backup zip file> <RSA recovery private key> --prv`
